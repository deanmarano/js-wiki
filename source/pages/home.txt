This is the wiki I made after reading Apprenticeship Patterns. It uses
many of my current favorite technologies:

* HTML5
* HAML
* Coffeescript
* SASS
* Markdown

All articles are stored in HTML localStorage, so it only persists in the
current browser. Since I'm looking to implement in all client-side JS, I'm
still figuring out the best way to persist. If you have any ideas, tweet me!

# How To Use
To use this wiki, you'll need to know Markdown. You can find more
info on [DaringFireball.com](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
The main navigation is through the 'pages'
link. You can create pages and they will show up here. Linking between
pages are simply Markdown links to the permalinks. A link that says 'this' to the 
help page, for example, would look like `[this](#help)`.

Everything here is a page you can edit. The home page, the help page, and any
page you create. Simply click the edit link in the top right corner of every
page to start editing. There is a live preview, which will show you exactly what
the markdown will look like once rendered.
